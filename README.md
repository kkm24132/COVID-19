### 1.2 Definition
COVID-19 stands for Corona Virus Disease. It is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease was first identified in Wuhan, China in 2019.

- Common Symptoms
  - Fever, Dry Caugh, Breathing problem, Fatigue etc.
- Uncommon Symptoms
  - Headache, Nasal congestion, Sore throat, Coughing, Pain in muscles or joints, Diarrhoea, Nausea and/or vomiting, Kidney failure, Pneumonia etc.

### 1.4 Prevention Points
- Clean hand with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub
- Cover nose and mouth when coughing & sneezing with a tissue or flexed elbow
- Avoid close contact & maintain 1-meter distance with anyone who is coughing or sneezing
- Isolation of persons traveling from affected countries or places for at least 14 days
- Quarantine if advised

### 1.5 Health and Well-being

- Destress yourself with a 20-20-20 rule: Spending endless hours in front of your laptop can strain your eyes. For every 20 minutes you spend looking at your screen of laptop/computer, look at something 20 feet away, for 20 seconds.
- [Office stretches](https://github.com/kkm24132/COVID-19/tree/master/Artifacts/office_stretches.pdf) - It can be tempting to stay at your desk, but periodic, micro-breaks for movement throughout the day can help you stay energized and reduce tension.

## 3. Solution and PoV efforts

Input data sources:
- Thermal imaging cameras
- CCTV camera images (both images + video clippings)
- Thermal temperature monitoring devices and logs of those based on human wise monitoring
- Bluetooth beacons
- Smartphone devices with GPS enabled

Based on above data, following insights at workplace can be looked at. It can work as a Predictive Solution to alert the firm or authority.
