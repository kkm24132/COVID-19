### 1.2 Definition
COVID-19 stands for Corona Virus Disease. It is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease was first identified in Wuhan, China in 2019.

### 1.3 Symptoms
It's symptoms in humans are as follows at a high level:

| Category of Symptoms | Description |
|          --          |      --     |
| More Common Symptoms | Fever, Dry Cough, Fatigue / Tiredness, Breathing discomfort |
| Less Common Symptoms | Aches and Pains, Headache, Nasal Congestion, Sore throat, Diarrhoea, Conjuctivitis, Loss of taste or smell, A rash on skin etc. |
| Serious Symptoms     | High difficulty of breathing or shortness of breath, Chest pain or pressure, Loss of speech or movement |

On average it takes 5–6 days from when someone is infected with the virus for symptoms to show, however it can take up to 14 days.
This may change as we experience very dynamic symptoms across the globe and different waves of infections across the globe are appearing at different geographies.

### 1.4 Prevention Points
Protect yourself and others around you by knowing the facts and taking appropriate precautions. Follow advice provided by your local and government health authority. Some steps that can be taken for prevention efforts are as follows:
- Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.
- Maintain a safe distance (ideally at least 1-meter distance) from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
- Cover nose and mouth when coughing & sneezing with a tissue or flexed elbow.
- Wear a mask when physical distancing is not possible. Don’t touch your eyes, nose or mouth.
- Stay home if you feel unwell.
- Isolation of persons traveling from affected countries or places for at least 14 days or as directed by local/state/government authorities from time to time.
- Quarantine if advised.
- If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention. Additionally, follow latest symptoms and try to protect yourself from those whenever desired. 
- It is important to keep up to date on types of symptoms as it may vary / change from time to time.


### 1.5 Vaccination

- Vaccination efforts have been started and in progress with tremendous efforts from scientists, researchers across the globe.
- Please refer [here on guidance document](https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/sites/default/files/documents/Status_COVID_VAX_16Feb2021.pdf) for latest details of vaccines available globally 
- Further [vaccine details list](https://www.raps.org/news-and-articles/news-articles/2020/3/covid-19-vaccine-tracker) from RAPS.org
- Known active vaccines list:
  - Comirnaty(BNT162b2) - mRNA based vaccine
  - Moderna (mRNA-1273) - mRNA based vaccine
  - AstraZeneca (AZD1222) / Vaxzevria / Covishield - Adenovirus vaccine
  - Sputnik V - Recombinant Adenovirus vaccine (rAd26 and rAd5)
  - Janssen (JNJ-78436735; Ad26.COV2.S) - Non-replicating viral vector
  - CoronaVac - Inactivated vaccine (formalin with alum adjuvant)
  - BBIBP-CorV - Inactivated vaccine
  - EpiVacCorona - Peptide vaccine
  - Convidicea (Ad5-nCoV) - Recombinant vaccine (adenovirus type 5 vector)
  - Covaxin - Inactivated vaccine

### 1.6 Health and Well-being

- Destress yourself with a 20-20-20 rule: Spending endless hours in front of your laptop can strain your eyes. For every 20 minutes you spend looking at your screen of laptop/computer, look at something 20 feet away, for 20 seconds.
- [Office stretches](https://github.com/kkm24132/COVID-19/tree/master/Artifacts/office_stretches.pdf) - It can be tempting to stay at your desk, but periodic, micro-breaks for movement throughout the day can help you stay energized and reduce tension.
